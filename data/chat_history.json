    "text": "I'd be happy to help you with a simple Character Controller script in C# for Unity.\n\nHere's a basic implementation:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class CharacterControllerSimple : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public float speed = 5.0f;\n    public float jumpForce = 10.0f;\n    private Vector3 velocity = Vector3.zero;\n\n    void Update()\n    {\n        // Get input from the player\n        float moveHorizontal = Input.GetAxis(\"Horizontal\");\n        float moveVertical = Input.GetAxis(\"Vertical\");\n\n        // Create a new vector to hold the movement\n        Vector3 movement = new Vector3(moveHorizontal, 0.0f, moveVertical);\n\n        // Apply the movement\n        velocity += movement * speed * Time.deltaTime;\n\n        // Jump\n        if (Input.GetButtonDown(\"Jump\") && IsGrounded())\n        {\n            velocity.y = jumpForce;\n        }\n\n        // Move the character\n        transform.position += velocity * Time.deltaTime;\n\n        // Reset the velocity for the next frame\n        velocity *= 0.9f; // to prevent floating point precision errors\n\n        if (IsGrounded() && velocity.y < 0)\n        {\n            velocity = new Vector3(velocity.x, 0.0f, velocity.z);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if the character is grounded\n    bool IsGrounded()\n    {\n        return Physics.Raycast(transform.position, Vector3.down, 1.1f, LayerMask.GetMask(\"Ground\"));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis script will make your character move forward and backward when you press the 'W' and 'S' keys respectively, and jump when you press the space bar.\n\nYou'll also need to add a collider to your character game object with the \"Ground\" layer mask assigned. This will allow the CharacterControllerSimple script to detect whether the character is grounded or not.\n\nPlease note that this script uses a very basic movement system and doesn't include any collision detection or response, so you may want to add those features depending on your specific needs.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about how this script works or if there's anything else I can help with!",
